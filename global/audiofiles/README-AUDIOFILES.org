Any audiofiles placed in this directory will be loaded to buffers in the default server when it boots.

Each buffer is stored as a single entry under ...

The file name extensions used can be any one of:
#+begin_src
   .wav
   .WAV
   .aif
   .aiff
#+end_src

These files are intentionally ignored by git and are not uploaded to github because of restrictions in file size.  See file .gitignore for details.
